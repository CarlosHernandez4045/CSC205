## Week 4 Parsing Strings Assignment
This is week 4's parsing strings assignment. 
It contains 5 different files, implementing each sample from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-ways-reading-text-file-java/.
It contains my own implementation, but the same method used. Each file also contains a different method that reads them as each character in the file, if wanted.
